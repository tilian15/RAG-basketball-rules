Therefore, the floor shall have dimensions of a minimum of 32 m in length and a minimum of 19 m in width.  2.3 Backcourt A team's backcourt consists of its team's own basket, the inbounds part of the backboard and that part of the court limited by the endline behind its own basket, the sidelines and the centre line.  2.4 Frontcourt A team's frontcourt consists of the opponents' basket, the inbounds part of the backboard and that part of the court limited by the endline behind the opponents' basket, the sidelines and the inner edge of the centre line nearest to the opponents' basket.  2.5 Lines All lines shall be of the same colour and marked in white or other contrasting colour, 5 cm in width and clearly visible.  2.5.1 Boundary line The court shall be limited by the boundary line, consisting of the endlines and the sidelines. These lines are not part of the court.  Any obstruction including seated head coach, first assistant coach, substitutes, excluded players and accompanying delegation members shall be at least 2 m from the court. 2.5.2 Centre line, centre circle and free-throw semi-circles The centre line shall be marked parallel to the endlines from the mid-point of the sidelines. It shall extend 0.15 m beyond each sideline. The centre line is part of the backcourt. The centre circle shall be marked in the centre of the court and have a radius of 1.80 m measured to the outer edge of the circumference. The free-throw semi-circles shall be marked on the court with a radius of 1.80 m measured to the outer edge of the circumference and with their centres at the mid-point of the free-throw lines (Diagram 3).\n",

      "RULE TWO – COURT AND EQUIPMENT Article 2 Court 2.1 Court The court shall have a flat, hard surface free from obstructions (Diagram 1) with dimensions of 28 m in length by 15 m in width measured from the inner edge of the boundary line.  2.2 Floor The floor shall include the court area surrounded by a further boundary lane free from obstructions with a minimum of 2 m in width (Diagram 2). Therefore, the floor shall have dimensions of a minimum of 32 m in length and a minimum of 19 m in width.  2.3 Backcourt A team's backcourt consists of its team's own basket, the inbounds part of the backboard and that part of the court limited by the endline behind its own basket, the sidelines and the centre line.  2.4 Frontcourt A team's frontcourt consists of the opponents' basket, the inbounds part of the backboard and that part of the court limited by the endline behind the opponents' basket, the sidelines and the inner edge of the centre line nearest to the opponents' basket.  2.5 Lines All lines shall be of the same colour and marked in white or other contrasting colour, 5 cm in width and clearly visible.  2.5.1 Boundary line The court shall be limited by the boundary line, consisting of the endlines and the sidelines. These lines are not part of the court.  Any obstruction including seated head coach, first assistant coach, substitutes, excluded players and accompanying delegation members shall be at least 2 m from the court. 2.5.2 Centre line, centre circle and free-throw semi-circles The centre line shall be marked parallel to the endlines from the mid-point of the sidelines. It shall extend 0.15 m beyond each sideline. The centre line is part of the backcourt. The centre circle shall be marked in the centre of the court and have a radius of 1.80 m measured to the outer edge of the circumference. The free-throw semi-circles shall be marked on the court with a radius of 1.80 m measured to the outer edge of the circumference and with their centres at the mid-point of the free-throw lines (Diagram 3).\n",

      "33.7 Screening: Legal and illegal Screening is an attempt to delay or prevent an opponent without the ball from reaching a desired position on the court.  Legal screening is when the player who is screening an opponent: • Was stationary (inside that player’s cylinder) when contact occurred. • Had both feet on the court when contact occurred. Illegal screening is when the player who is screening an opponent: • Was moving when contact occurred. • Did not give sufficient distance in setting a screen outside the field of vision of a stationary opponent when contact occurred. • Did not respect the elements of time and distance of an opponent in motion when contact occurred. If the screen is set within the field of vision of a stationary opponent (front or lateral), the screener may establish the screen as close as possible to the opponent, provided there is no contact. If the screen is set outside the field of vision of a stationary opponent, the screener must permit the opponent to take 1 normal step towards the screen without making contact. If the opponent is in motion, the elements of time and distance shall apply. The screener must leave enough space so that the player who is being screened is able to avoid the screen by stopping or changing direction. The distance required is never less than 1 and never more than 2 normal steps. A player who is legally screened is responsible for any contact with the player who has set the screen. 33.8 Charging Charging is illegal personal contact, with or without the ball, by pushing or moving into an opponent’s torso.  33.9 Blocking Blocking is illegal personal contact which impedes the progress of an opponent with or without the ball.  A player who is attempting to screen is committing a blocking foul if contact occurs when moving, and the opponent is stationary or retreating.  If a player disregards the ball, faces an opponent and shifts position as the opponent shifts, that player is primarily responsible for any contact that occurs, unless other factors are involved. The expression 'unless other factors are involved' refers to deliberate pushing, charging or holding of the player who is being screened. It is legal for a player to extend the arm(s) or elbow(s) outside of the cylinder in taking position on the court but they must be moved inside the cylinder when an opponent attempts to pass by. If the arm(s) or elbow(s) are outside the cylinder and contact occurs, it is blocking or holding.\n",

E.2 Rule E.2.1 In each quarter 1 Media time-out shall be permitted, in addition to the regular team time-outs. Media time-outs in an overtime shall not be permitted. E.2.2 The first time-out in each quarter (team or Media) shall be 60, 75, 90 or 100 seconds in duration. E.2.3 The duration of all other time-outs in a quarter shall be 60 seconds. E.2.4 Both teams shall be entitled to 2 time-outs during the first half and 3 time-outs during the second half. These time-outs may be requested at any time during the game and their duration may be: • If considered to be a Media time-out 60, 75, 90 or 100 seconds, i.e. the first in a quarter, or • If not considered to be a Media time-out 60 seconds, i.e. requested by either team, after the Media time-out has been granted. E.3 Procedure E.3.1 Ideally, the Media time-out shall be taken before the game clock shows 5:00 minutes or less remaining in the quarter. However, there is no guarantee that this shall be the case. E.3.2 If neither team has requested a time-out before the game clock shows 5:00 minutes or less remaining in the quarter then a Media time-out shall be granted at the first opportunity when the ball is dead and the game clock is stopped. This time-out shall not be charged against either team. E.3.3 If either team has been granted a time-out before the game clock shows 5:00 minutes or less remaining in the quarter, that time-out shall be used as a Media time-out. This time-out shall count as both a Media time-out and a team time-out for the team requesting it. E.3.4 According to this procedure, there would be a minimum of 1 time-out in each quarter and a maximum of 6 time-outs in the first half and a maximum of 8 time-outs in the second half.\n",
